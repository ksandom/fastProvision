# fastProvision

A fast and filthy way to provision a desktop environment.

## Target audience

Me. But feel free to adapt it for your needs.

## Background

Tools like Ansible and Puppet are incredibly slow and heavy. The goal of this is to get a machine up and running *fast*.

The biggest part of this is letting mature tools excel at what they do rather than micro-managing them.
