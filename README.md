# fastProvision

A fast and filthy way to provision a desktop environment and build chroot images.

This was initially intended as a proof of concept to prove a point. But has actually become suitable for building chroot images in a flexible, automated way.

## Using it.

Browse through the profiles directory structure and find the thing that most closely matches your situation. Feel free to add more. Once you've found what you're looking for, just give it a run.

    sudo ./profiles/chroots/devuan-jezzie-armhf-desktop
